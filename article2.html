       <p>When it comes to trying to discover music on a specific genre, over time you would more or less know what to expect. You’ll see similar patterns in technique, writing, guitar tone and the like. To be realistic, not every creation is as captivating however that is natural when it comes to art. That being the case, it wouldn’t really be as common to find something that resonates with me.</p>

       <p>The algorithm presents me with all kinds of content, both bad and good. I stumbled upon this eerie-looking album art on a video. I was enticed with the pale color scheme. Since it ticked something in me, I clicked it. When I heard the music, it exactly matched the same feeling when I saw the art. It felt like I was in a place that I was not supposed to be in. It made me imagine that I am in a desolate place. That is not something you would experience on a daily basis.</p>

       <p>The music does not have as much harmonic progression. Most of the tracks can be heard to reference the Phrygian Scale, heavily utilizing the minor 2nd interval. The sound design and layers gives off a nice cinematic effect. The overall compositions are very reminiscent and clearly influenced by Meshuggah, which is one of the respected names in progressive metal.</p>

       <p>The composition style is truly remarkable and inspiring. His music is a testament that you do not need flashy music theory, fancy chords or even words to create something that strongly evokes emotions. Rhythm, layers, and sound design can be enough.</p>

       <p>I know very little of this artist. I researched and I found that he is from Moldova in Eastern Europe. He also has Facebook page and has a couple of videos. I don’t think he is as active but I hope that he gets recognition.</p>
